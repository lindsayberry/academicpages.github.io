I'm a Statistical Scientist at [Berry Consultants](https://www.berryconsultants.com/) working on designing innovative and adaptive clinical trials. I completed my PhD in [Statistical Science](http://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/).

My research spans topics in forecasting and time series analysis, Bayesian dynamic models, high-dimensional computation, decision analysis, statistical computing, and more! I'm currently working on several applied biostatistics projects related to drug/device development. Berry Consultants is a consulting company that specializes in innovative, adaptive, and often Bayesian approaches to clinical trial design. On the publications tab, you can read about how the REMAP-CAP trial is answering important questions during the COVID-19 pandemic with a fully Bayesian, adaptive trial design.
